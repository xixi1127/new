<p>Artrific is the leader for NFT on FUSE Network. Artrific has all sorts of digital assets available on its platform, and it's free to sign up and browse the extensive offerings. It also supports artists and creators and has an easy-to-use process if you want to create your own NFT (known as "minting").</p>
<p>At the moment we support main FUSE token to buy and sell NFT (more token will be supported in the future when they are available on FUSE Network).</p>
<p>User not only can mint NFT on marketplace but also can import their collection that was minted before outside of marketplace if their collection is ERC-721 Standard. We will support ERC-1155 in the near future and more features coming out very soon.</p>
